      <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>This Privacy Notice is for the benefit of individuals whose personal data we process including, but not limited to, our clients (when such clients are individuals),  client personnel, counter-parties, counter-party personnel, other advisors, suppliers, supplier personnel, job applicants and individuals to whom we send marketing communications – referred to in this Privacy Notice as “you” and “your”.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Controller</h2>
      <p>Martyn Hopper & Partners Limited (Company No. 16750161), England & Wales. A data controller is a person or organisation who alone or jointly determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is, or is likely to be, processed.<p>
      <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:martyn@martynhopper.com">martyn@martynhopper.com</a></p>

      <h2>Obtaining your personal data</h2>
      <p>We may obtain your personal data from you or we may obtain it from a third party source. We might collect personal data from you in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact details and correspondence when you email us or submit enquiries.</li>
        <li>Business information you choose to share to help us understand your needs.</li>
        <li>Technical logs generated by our hosting platform (security and performance).</li>
        <li>Minimal, privacy-friendly usage analytics (see “Cookies &amp; analytics”).</li>
        <li>Newsletter details if you subscribe (email address, and if provided your name), plus consent and subscription preferences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We might also collect your personal data from clients/our clients’ personnel, agents and advisers, other advisers which represent you, the company for whom you work, other organisations/persons with whom you have dealings, government agencies, recruitment agencies, information or service providers and publicly available record.</p>

      <h2>How we use your data (lawful bases)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> responding to enquiries; operating, securing and improving our website; maintaining business records; marketing our own services to professional contacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> complying with applicable laws and regulatory requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where you opt in to receive Insights and updates by email (you can withdraw at any time via the unsubscribe link or by contacting us).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Newsletter &amp; updates</h2>
      <p>
        If you subscribe to our Insights and updates, we will process your email address (and, if you provide it, your name) to send you our emails. We use <strong>EmailOctopus</strong> as our email platform provider to create, send and manage these emails (including list management, deliverability and suppression of unsubscribed addresses). We use double opt-in and keep records of consent (who, when, how).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our emails may include standard measurement technologies (e.g. open and click tracking) to help us understand reach and engagement. You can opt out of marketing at any time via the unsubscribe link in our emails. You can also reduce tracking by disabling images in your email client.
      </p>
      <p>
        We retain your details while you remain subscribed. If you unsubscribe, we keep a minimal suppression record to ensure you do not receive further marketing emails.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect data from children and our mailing list is not intended for individuals under 16.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We use trusted processors to operate our business infrastructure, including Microsoft 365 (email/document storage), our hosting provider (Kinsta), and EmailOctopus (email platform). We do not sell your personal data. We only share data where necessary for the purposes above or if required by law, under appropriate contractual safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is primarily processed in the UK/EU. EmailOctopus is UK-based but uses AWS infrastructure which may involve processing outside the UK/EEA. Where international transfers occur, we rely on an adequacy decision or on appropriate safeguards such as the UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (and equivalent EU SCCs) to protect your information.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>
        It is our policy to retain your personal data for the length of time required for the specific purposes for which it is processed by. However, we may be obliged to keep your personal data for a longer period, for example, where required by our legal and regulatory obligations or in order to ensure we have effective back-up systems. In such cases, we will ensure that your personal data will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Notice, restrict access to any archived personal data and ensure that all personal data is held securely and kept confidential.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have rights under UK data protection law, including to access, correct, erase, restrict or object to processing, and data portability (where applicable). You can exercise these rights by contacting us. You also have the right to complain to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (<a href="https://ico.org.uk" rel="noopener">ico.org.uk</a>).
      </p>
