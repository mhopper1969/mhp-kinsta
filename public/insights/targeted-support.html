      <h1>Targeted support, suitability and hindsight risk</h1>

      <p>
        The FCA’s targeted support regime (PS25/22) is intended to close the advice gap by allowing firms to provide
        ready-made suggestions to consumer segments with shared needs or characteristics, without triggering the full
        cost and friction associated with individualised advice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The policy objective is clear. The operational reality is more subtle. Targeted support reduces ex ante prescription,
        but it does not remove outcomes-based scrutiny. In particular, the FCA has been explicit that both
        <strong>Principle 9 (suitability)</strong> and <strong>Principle 12 (Consumer Duty)</strong> continue to apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        This briefing focuses on what that means in practice, why hindsight reconstruction risk becomes the dominant exposure,
        and how firms can make predictable, defensible use of the regime.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What PS25/22 changes (and what it does not)</h2>

      <p>
        PS25/22 introduces a new framework for targeted support in pensions and investments. The regime is designed to sit
        between generic information/guidance and full regulated advice. It allows firms to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>define <strong>consumer segments</strong> with shared needs, objectives or characteristics;</li>
        <li>provide <strong>ready-made suggestions</strong> intended to be appropriate for those segments;</li>
        <li>do so without conducting a full individualised suitability assessment in the COBS 9/9A sense.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The key point is that targeted support is not a “safe harbour”. The detailed COBS suitability machinery may not apply
        in full, but the core normative standards—suitability and good outcomes—remain in play via Principles 9 and 12.
      </p>

      <h2>2. The structural tension: “better position” vs “good outcomes”</h2>

      <p>
        The FCA frames the objective of targeted support as placing consumers in a <strong>better position</strong>, rather than
        guaranteeing an outcome. This helps differentiate targeted support from advice and avoids implying a promise of performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the Consumer Duty’s organising concept is <strong>good outcomes</strong>, including preventing foreseeable harm,
        supporting consumer understanding and ensuring fair value. Once harm crystallises—particularly in volatile markets—reviewers
        will naturally gravitate towards outcomes-based reasoning.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, firms should assume that the “better position” framing will not, on its own, constrain hindsight evaluation.
        The defensibility of design choices will matter more than labels.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Why hindsight reconstruction becomes the dominant risk</h2>

      <p>
        Targeted support reduces front-end prescription. The trade-off is that firms must be able to reconstruct, defend and evidence
        their judgement later. In complaints, supervision or enforcement, the questions tend to be concrete:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Why was the consumer placed in this segment?</li>
        <li>What risks were identified as foreseeable at the design stage—and how were they mitigated?</li>
        <li>What assumptions were made about consumer understanding and behaviour?</li>
        <li>Why was the ready-made suggestion reasonable given what was known at the time?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is the critical mindset shift: targeted support is less about satisfying a prescribed process and more about demonstrating
        that the firm operated a <strong>governed decision-making system</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Segment design is a regulated judgement, not a marketing exercise</h2>

      <p>
        PS25/22 expressly warns against segmentation becoming so granular that it replicates advice-level personalisation. This warning
        is important, because commercial incentives push towards more tailoring: more questions, more nuance, higher conversion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The risk is “segment drift”: targeted support journeys slowly become advice-like in substance. That creates two problems:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Boundary fragility</strong>: if the journey looks and feels like individualised advice, it becomes harder to rely on
          the segment-based framing when challenged.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expectation inflation</strong>: the more personalised the journey appears, the more likely reviewers are to import
          advice-like expectations under suitability and the Duty.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Firms need a disciplined approach to segment definition, including documented inclusion/exclusion criteria, explicit assumptions,
        and a clear rationale for the trade-offs being made.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Communications and behavioural design will be scrutinised</h2>

      <p>
        Under targeted support, a technically accurate disclosure is rarely a complete defence. The Consumer Duty raises the bar from
        “clear and not misleading” to “supports understanding in practice”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firms should expect scrutiny of design choices such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>salience and sequencing of risk information;</li>
        <li>defaults, nudges and friction;</li>
        <li>how downside scenarios are presented relative to headline benefits;</li>
        <li>how the firm tests whether consumers actually understood key risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In short: outcomes-based regulation tends to become behavioural regulation in practice.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Making the regime predictable: a practical operating model</h2>

      <p>
        Firms can use targeted support safely and at scale, but it requires disciplined governance. The starting point is to treat
        targeted support as a system that must be defensible under retrospective review.
      </p>

      <h3>Six design and governance disciplines</h3>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Define segments as regulatory artefacts</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Document trade-offs explicitly</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Foreseeable harm registers for each segment</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Evidence “support for understanding”</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Change management and monitoring</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Complaints defensibility pack</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The objective is to make targeted support predictable: not by eliminating judgement, but by making judgement transparent,
        governed and evidenced.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Targeted support can expand access and reduce friction. But firms should be under no illusion: the continued application of
        Principle 9 and the Consumer Duty means the regime does not remove suitability and outcomes thinking—it relocates it into
        governance quality and hindsight defensibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firms that treat targeted support as “advice-lite” will find that complexity is not removed, only deferred. Firms that treat it
        as a governed decision-making system can use it with confidence.
